		<h1>MySQL</h1>

		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>The MySQL plugin allows you to perform some maintenance tasks on your
		DotClear database through a web interface.</p>

		<p>This release lets you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#optimize">optimize your database</a>,</li>
			<li><a href="#backup">backup your database</a> in a SQL script,</li>
			<li><a href="#restore">restore your database</a> from a SQL script created by the plugin.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="optimize">Optimize</h2>
		<p>A MySQL database can be seen as a set of files. Each deletion or modification adds fragmentation to it.</p>
		<p>The <strong>Optimize</strong> operation performs an OPTIMIZE TABLE request on every DotClear table in order to compact them.</p>
		<p>On most setups, you do not have to use <strong>Optimize</strong> daily.
		Even if you often update your posts, it is enough to launch this procedure on a monthly basis.</p>
		<p>Such a procedure has no impact whatsoever on your data's integrity. It is totally risk-free.</p>

		<h2 id="backup">backup</h2>
		<p>One cannot repeat too often how important it is to make regular backups of your data.<br>With the <strong>Backup</strong> procedure, it has no more reasons to not become an automatism.</p>
		<p>This procedure creates a complete "dump" of your DotClear database. We call "dump" a SQL script containing the instructions to recreate your DotClear database.<br>This file is gzip compressed to save space.</p>
		<p>Should you wish to do so, this dump still can be used directly in phpMyAdmin.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt id="send_it">Immediate download</dt>
			<dd>This option allows you to select whether your wish the plug in to save the dump or to download it.<br>The default setting is to have it checked, you directly download the file on your computer and there is no local save on the server.<br>By unselecting it, the file will be saved to a <strong>mysql/</strong>  sub-folder in your DotClear <strong>share/</strong> folder.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2 id="restore">Restore</h2>
		<p>It is the opposite of the backup procedure. This one allows you to load a backup file in the eventuality of a problem with your MySQL database.</p>
		<p>Hopefully, it should be the less used procedure of this plugin.</p>
		<p>The restore runs every SQL request of the dump file. It means that <strong>every piece of data still to be found in your DotClear database will be overwritten</strong>.<br>
		The users accounts will be affected too.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt id="dumpfile">Dumpfile to restore</dt>
			<dd>Use the <strong>browse...</strong> button to select, on your hard drive, the SQL dump to restore.</dd>
		</dl>
